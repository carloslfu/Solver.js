Objectjs library(Ojs) - last version relase 1.0

-what is this?: Is a javascript based library for easy handling of objects.
-What can I do? you can do whatever you can think, if it cant do with Objectjs send your idea and if you want collaborate on their development
-give me an example:
if you want to convert to JSON string your object and it contains functions, the standard JSON.stringify function does not suport that, but in Ojs is simple:

*include a object.js library in your code.
*code:
//target to convert to JSON string
target={"k":function (){console.log("adasd");},"i":1,"f":"1","obj":{"k":function (){console.log("adasd");},"i":1,"f":"1"}};
json_str=(new Ojs(target)).toStr();//this is your json string
//to decode the string
object_decoded=(new Ojs()).toOjs(json_str).toClearObj();
//now you can call your functions and access to your object_decoded
//Ojs support nested objects
*you can too:
-manage your object like an array with objectAt(), objectNameAt(),last(),last(),lastObjectName() and more functions
-get the length of your object with getLength()
